Samuel Wilson, a retired \nmerchant sailor, his family and servants lived in 1 Clanwilliam Place, \nwhile the family and servants of carpenter and contractor Andrew Mathers \noccupied 2 Clanwilliam Place, next door. (NAI, 1911 census returns; \nDCLA, Dublin City Electoral Rolls, 1915; Thom’s Directory, 1916). \nA large, three-storey building, it offered an unobstructed view of the bridge \nand down Northumberland Road. On Easter Monday, the building was occupied by \nGeorge Reynolds (section commander), Daniel Byrne, William Ronan and James Doyle, \nthe door having been opened for them by a maid (MAI, BMH WS 309). On Tuesday morning, \nPaddy Doyle, Richard Murphy and brothers Thomas and James Walsh were sent from \nBoland’s Bakery, headquarters of the 3rd Battalion under its commandant, \nEamon de Valera, to reinforce the garrison in Clanwilliam House. \nDaniel Byrne was assigned to carry dispatches leaving seven men \nin possession of Clanwilliam House on Wednesday morning. By that time, furniture\nhad been used to fortify windows but the glass had not been smashed and \nno other measures taken to prepare for an assault on the building. Each Volunteer \nwas positioned at one of ten second and third storey windows at the front of the \nhouse facing the canal. On hearing fire from 25 Northumberland Road, the garrison \nopened fire on the advancing Sherwood Foresters. Clanwilliam House was the last of the \nrebel posts to fall following a concerted rush by troops from the 2/8th and 2/7th Sherwood \nForesters during which the house caught fire. George Reynolds, Paddy Doyle and Richard Murphy \nwere killed during the fighting (MAI, BMH WS 127; MAI, BMH WS 309; MAI, BMH WS 198). \nThe building remained unoccupied after the Rising until it collapsed during a storm in 1920 \n(Thom’s Directory, 1917; Irish Independent, 18 Jan. 1920).",

            "description": "Clanwilliam House, 1-2 Clanwilliam Place, was part of a row of Georgian \nhouses on the city side of Mount Street Bridge on the intersection with \nLower Mount Street and facing the Grand Canal. Samuel Wilson, a retired \nmerchant sailor, his family and servants lived in 1 Clanwilliam Place, \nwhile the family and servants of carpenter and contractor Andrew Mathers \noccupied 2 Clanwilliam Place, next door. (NAI, 1911 census returns; \nDCLA, Dublin City Electoral Rolls, 1915; Thom’s Directory, 1916). \nA large, three-storey building, it offered an unobstructed view of the bridge \nand down Northumberland Road. On Easter Monday, the building was occupied by \nGeorge Reynolds (section commander), Daniel Byrne, William Ronan and James Doyle, \nthe door having been opened for them by a maid (MAI, BMH WS 309). On Tuesday morning, \nPaddy Doyle, Richard Murphy and brothers Thomas and James Walsh were sent from \nBoland’s Bakery, headquarters of the 3rd Battalion under its commandant, \nEamon de Valera, to reinforce the garrison in Clanwilliam House. \nDaniel Byrne was assigned to carry dispatches leaving seven men \nin possession of Clanwilliam House on Wednesday morning. By that time, furniture\nhad been used to fortify windows but the glass had not been smashed and \nno other measures taken to prepare for an assault on the building. Each Volunteer \nwas positioned at one of ten second and third storey windows at the front of the \nhouse facing the canal. On hearing fire from 25 Northumberland Road, the garrison \nopened fire on the advancing Sherwood Foresters. Clanwilliam House was the last of the \nrebel posts to fall following a concerted rush by troops from the 2/8th and 2/7th Sherwood \nForesters during which the house caught fire. George Reynolds, Paddy Doyle and Richard Murphy \nwere killed during the fighting (MAI, BMH WS 127; MAI, BMH WS 309; MAI, BMH WS 198). \nThe building remained unoccupied after the Rising until it collapsed during a storm in 1920 \n(Thom’s Directory, 1917; Irish Independent, 18 Jan. 1920).",

                "description": "The Diaconie Weeshuis does not exist anymore. It was demolished and replaced\nby a new building in 1888. The model was therefore based on historical maps,\ndepictions and 19th century photography. \n\nThe sources give some indications of the construction materials used for the\nwalls, windows, and roofs. No colour photography was invented before the\ndemolition of this building, so the best indication is gained from this 1785\ndrawing van H.P. Schouten. The building most likely had reddish bricks,\nsandstone blocks in the recessed arches on ground floor, and all woodwork\npainted off-white or yellow (although this may have changed over its\nlifetime). The gates and pediments on the roof were most likely of a kind of\nstone, either with natural surface or painted to match the woodwork. The\nshutters appear to have been painted in a greyish tone. From the other\ndepictions we know that the roof was covered with small diamond shaped slate\ntiles.",
