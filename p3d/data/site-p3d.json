The platform intends to target the unique needs\nand abilities of both the content creators (researchers, educators, cultural\nheritage managers) as well as the end-users (students, public, academics,\netc.).\n\nBuilding on the conventions of text-based digital scholarly editions, PURE3D\nwill provide tools to integrate multiple types of source materials (e.g.,\nannotations, images, video, structured/unstructured data) and document the\ncreation process (paradata), providing users with direct access to the\nmodelling and interpretative choices creating a multimodal resource\nimpossible to replicate in print form.\n\nPURE3D is aware of the issues that research-based 3D content creators may\nencounter in making their projects and data accessible on the web. File size,\nformat, technical know-how and funding are some of the issues. The PURE3D\nplatform will act as a preservation repository for projects, developing a\nconceptual and methodological framework for valorizing and evaluating 3D\nscholarship, so that the outputs of 3D digital scholarship can meaningfully\ncontribute to the whole of the academic ecosystem.\n\nThe PURE3D Project is based out of the\n[Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-arts-and-social-sciences)\nunder the direction of\n[Dr. Costas Papadopoulos](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/k.papadopoulos)\nand\nProf. Susan Schreibman.\nA number of partner institutions join PURE3D as pilot\nprojects or in advisory roles and technical support. \n\n**This platform is in a alpha-phase of production and is currently only\ndisplaying a selection of 3D editions developed by project partners in the\nlast year. As such, it is not yet possible to build and publish your own 3D\nproject at this time. Please follow us on social media as development on the\nplatform continues.

File size, format, technical know-how and funding are some of the issues. The PURE3D platform will act as a publication infrastructure for 3D editions, developing a conceptual and methodological framework for valorizing and evaluating 3D scholarship, so that 3D outputs can meaningfully contribute to the academic ecosystem. </p>\n\n<p> The PURE3D Project is based out of the <a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-arts-and-social-sciences\">Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences</a> at <a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/\">Maastricht University</a> under the direction of <a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/k.papadopoulos\">Dr. Costas Papadopoulos</a> and Prof. Susan Schreibman.
