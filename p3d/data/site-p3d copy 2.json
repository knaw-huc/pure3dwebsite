On Tuesday morning, \nPaddy Doyle, Richard Murphy and brothers Thomas and James Walsh were sent from \nBoland’s Bakery, headquarters of the 3rd Battalion under its commandant, \nEamon de Valera, to reinforce the garrison in Clanwilliam House. \nDaniel Byrne was assigned to carry dispatches leaving seven men \nin possession of Clanwilliam House on Wednesday morning. By that time, furniture\nhad been used to fortify windows but the glass had not been smashed and \nno other measures taken to prepare for an assault on the building. Each Volunteer \nwas positioned at one of ten second and third storey windows at the front of the \nhouse facing the canal. On hearing fire from 25 Northumberland Road, the garrison \nopened fire on the advancing Sherwood Foresters. Clanwilliam House was the last of the \nrebel posts to fall following a concerted rush by troops from the 2/8th and 2/7th Sherwood \nForesters during which the house caught fire. George Reynolds, Paddy Doyle and Richard Murphy \nwere killed during the fighting (MAI, BMH WS 127; MAI, BMH WS 309; MAI, BMH WS 198). \nThe building remained unoccupied after the Rising until it collapsed during a storm in 1920 \n(Thom’s Directory, 1917; Irish Independent, 18 Jan. 1920).</p>","provenance":"<p>This model was created by 3D artist <em>John Buckley</em>.</p>","title":"Clanwilliam House"},"project":{"_id":{"$oid":"64649d1ef24ec1b737dcc48e"},"dc":{"abstract":"<p>The Battle of Mount Street Bridge 3D Scholarly Model\ndetails the events and actors of a key battle\nwhich occurred during the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, Ireland.</p>","audience":["Digital Humanities","Early Modern History","Irish History"],"contributor":["Kelly Gillikin Schoueri","Costas Papadopoulos","Billy Donnelly","Luca Moines","John Kaulakis","Sandra Boheme Martinez"],"coverage":{"period":"1900-1950 CE","place":"British Isles"},"creator":"Susan Schreibman","dateAccepted":"2022-10-12","dateSubmitted":"2022-04-18","description":"<p>The Battle of Mount Street Bridge 3D Scholarly Model\nis a 3D photorealistic construction of the area around Mount Street Bridge\nthat transports users back to a leafy suburb in Dublin, Ireland, in April 1916\nto better understand the spatial and temporal dimensions\nof one of the most important battles in the Easter Rising.\nDuring this battle, the first of the week-long event, against all odds,\na small group of Irish Volunteers held off two battalions of\nBritish soldiers for the better part of the day.\nThe goal of the project is to better understand the battle,\nbringing new insights to this century-old event. </p>\n\n<p>The project contains four Voyager Instances\nthat help to tell both big narratives about the socio-political\ncontext of the 1916 Rising,\nthe events before, during and after the Battle of Mount Street Bridge,\nas well as the human toll of the Battle of Mount Street Bridge\non individuals from both sides of the conflict.\nThe 3D models of the neighborhood and individual buildings\noffer an interactive method of telling these stories.\nArchival images, records and oral accounts enrich the 3D model of the buildings\nso that the stories are authenticated by primary sources. </p>","instructionalMethod":"The Battle of Mount Street Bridge 3D Scholarly Model\ncontains four individual Voyager instances for exploring and learning\nabout the events and actors of Mount Street.\nThe project is designed in a way that offers optional additional layers\nof linked open data for further exploration of the base narrative. \n\nThe first voyager instance is offers a broad overview of the wider battle\nin terms of volunteer positioning and prep as well as British movements\nto the area of conflict.

The platform intends to target the unique needs and abilities of both the content creators (researchers, educators, cultural heritage managers) as well as the end-users (students, public, academics, etc.). </p>\n\n<p> Building on the conventions of text-based digital scholarly editions, PURE3D will provide tools to integrate multiple types of source materials (e.g., annotations, images, video, structured/unstructured data) and document the creation process (paradata), providing users with direct access to the modelling and interpretative choices creating a multimodal resource impossible to replicate in print form. </p>\n\n<p> PURE3D is aware of the issues that research-based 3D content creators may encounter in making their projects and data accessible on the web. File size, format, technical know-how and funding are some of the issues. The PURE3D platform will act as a preservation repository for projects, developing a conceptual and methodological framework for valorizing and evaluating 3D scholarship, so that the outputs of 3D digital scholarship can meaningfully contribute to the whole of the academic ecosystem. </p>\n\n<p> The PURE3D Project is based out of the <a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-arts-and-social-sciences\">Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences</a> at <a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/\">Maastricht University</a> under the direction of <a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/k.papadopoulos\">Dr. Costas Papadopoulos</a> and Prof. Susan Schreibman. A number of partner institutions join PURE3D as pilot projects or in advisory roles and technical support. </p>\n\n<p> This platform is in a beta-phase of production and is currently only displaying a selection of 3D editions developed by project partners in the last year. As such, it is not yet possible to build and publish your own 3D project at this time. Please follow us on social media as development on the platform continues.
